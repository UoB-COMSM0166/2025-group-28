Games we find inspiring and an overview of their mechanics:


Tower defense 
    Standard mechanic: Place towers/units to defend against waves of advancing enemies. Popular examples include BloonsTD.

    Potential twists:     

   1)  See Legion TD (warcraft 3 custom map) 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kws87-KcYaY example gameplay 
    Towers are also units (can move/allows multiplayer) - can be offensive not just defensive.
    Some other multiplayer mechanics e.g. your tower goes to defend the main base at the end of the wave because some teammates may have leaked 

   2)  See Nexus Wars (starcraft 2 custom map) 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr44PG1WLh0 example game 
    Tug of war style lane management game 
    Build structures that generate income and spawn units into a lane 
    Win by destroying opponent's base 
    Could make two player tug-of-war on same game using same keyboard (e.g. arrows vs WASD)?

    3) See Card Wars https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Wars_(game)

    Card based tower defense board game. Card are either creatures, buildings ∨ spells. 
    Set up a terrain type (swamp, cornfield, jungle etc), of your choice on 4 lanes, if the terrain type matches the type of the creature, you can form strategies around this. 
    Win when opponent has no more creature cards 
    Plants vs zombies. Everyone should know this one.
    Could do twist on this?

 
Other Ideas:

2D platformer like mario 

    Totally random idea:  

    Goat simulator, collect coins, upgrade horns,  headbutt children, increase mana meter, summon devil ∨ something – goal is to reach the barn 

 

Potential Twists/Enhancements:
   1) Something with procedural generation 
    Most obvious choice would be a roguelike 
    E.g. The Binding of Isaac / Nuclear Throne etc. 
    2) Concept of permadeath is interesting to explore, even in other game types as well as roguelikes – bit of a trump card that can instantly make a game way harder (and more fun?) 
    3) Two-player within same session (e.g. sharing keyboard)
